Data analysis and visualization of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin website.  This project uses Python for grabbing data from NOAA servers and cleaning the data into a MySQL command.  The visualization is done entirely with Javascript.  The back end of the website is made with PhP and MySQL.
